 * one active handler at a time. This block is released upon return
 * from the handler. Instead of blocking the timer from within the
 * handler it is safe to remove this timer and register a new timer as
 * soon as this is required.
 *
 * @attention Be aware of the fact that even a blocked timer consumes
 * resources. This is due to the fact that even if all timers are
 * blocked, the system's interval timer is still active calling the
 * facility's signal-handler. Here still all registered timers are
 * controlled for expiry and correspondingly marked, even if not
 * called immediately. The actual call will be carried out as soon as
 * the signal is unblocked. Thus, removing a timer via @ref
 * Timer_remove() usually saves resources compared to blocking a timer
 * for an undefined period.

 *        be blocked.

 * was not blocked, 0 will be returned. If an error occurred, -1 will be

 * handler within the Timer facility only sets flags marking elapsed
 * timers. The actual work is done within this function.
 *
 * Thus it looks for timers marked to be elapsed and not blocked. If
 * such a timer is found, the corresponding @a timeoutHandler as
 * registered within @ref Timer_register() is called.
 *
 * Since the actual work is done within this function, it is crucial
 * to call it on a regular basis in order to guarantee the handling of
 * the timers. Ideal points are immediately around central select()
 * calls or somewhere within a main loop of a program.
 *
 * As an example, the Selector facility uses Timers in order to
 * provide certain functionality. Here @ref Timer_handleSignals() is
 * called every time before going into the central select(). Be aware
 * of the fact that this select() is interrupted on a regular basis
 * due to signals sent to the process because of elapsed timers.
 *
 * @return No return value.
