 * daemon infrastructure.
 *
 * Messages might be sent via PSIcomm_send() and received through
 * PSIcomm_recv().
 *
 * In order to identify the availability of new messages to be
 * received this function returns a file-descriptor which might be
 * used in select()'s readfds set of file-descriptors for
 * multiplexing.
 *
 * @return file-descriptor used for actual communication with the
 * local forwarder. This one might be used within select()'s
 * file-descriptor sets in order to identify availability of new
 * messages. On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.
