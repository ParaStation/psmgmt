Running include-what-you-use sporadically over the sources might be helpful

To check all files within an directory start with:
for f in <dir>/*.[ch]; do include-what-you-use -I include -I bin/daemon -I <dir> $f; if [ $? -ne 2 ]; then echo $f >> unresolved; fi; done

Further iterations might be made via:
mv -f unresolved checks; for f in `cat checks`; do include-what-you-use -I include -I bin/daemon -I <dir> $f; if [ $? -ne 2 ]; then echo $f >> unresolved; fi; done
