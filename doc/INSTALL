Installing ParaStation
======================

0. Notes

   - The steps (2) through (5) must be performed on all nodes of your
     cluster.
   - You might want to setup your cluster so that /opt/parastation is
     mirrored (via NFS) from one node to all other nodes. Then you
     need to perform the steps (1), (6) and (7) only on this
     node. Otherwise these steps must be followed on all nodes, too.
   - You must be superuser (root) when installing ParaStation.


1. Extracting the Distribution

  ParaStation is distributed as a gzipped tar file that should be
  installed in the root (/) directory:

  	cd /
	gzip -cd psm_xxx.tgz | tar xvf -


2. Creating the Device

  If not yet done (from a previous installation), you must create a
  character device:

	mknod /dev/psm c 40 0
	chmod 666 /dev/psm


3. Services

  The following (7) lines must be appended to /etc/services:

  -------------------- snip --------------------
  # ParaStation entries
  psld             887/tcp       # ParaStation License Daemon Start Port
  psid             888/tcp       # ParaStation Daemon Start Port
  # end of ParaStation entries 
  -------------------- snip --------------------

4. Multicast setup

  ParaStation needs Multicast support on all nodes, i.e. the installed
  kernel has to support it. This is usually no problem if a standard
  kernel from a common distribution is used. You have to enable Multicast
  support if you build you own kernel. To learn more about Multicast take
  a look at the 'Multicast over TCP/IP HOWTO' [1].

  On nodes with more than one ethernet interface you have to setup a
  defaultroute for the Multicast traffic. This is done by

	route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev ethX

  where ethX has to be replaced by the name of the interface connecting
  to all other nodes.

  Usually only the front-end machine has to used ethernet interfaces.
  Then you have to add the Multicast route to the interface connecting
  the front-end with all the nodes.

5. (X)inetd Configuration

  This part of the installation process differs for the various Linux
  distributions. If your system has 
  - a file named /etc/inetd.conf (SuSE based distributions), read
    section 4.1,
  - a directory /etc/xinetd.d (RedHat based distributions), read
    section 4.2.

5.1 Inetd Configuration

  The following lines must be appended to /etc/inetd.conf:

  -------------------- snip --------------------
  #
  # ParaStation daemon
  #
  psid stream tcp nowait root /opt/parastation/bin/psid
  #
  # ParaStation license server
  #
  psld stream tcp nowait root /opt/parastation/bin/psld
  -------------------- snip --------------------

  Now, the inetd daemon must be triggered to reload this file:

	/etc/init.d/inetd reload


5.2 Xinetd Configuration

  Create a file named /etc/xinetd.d/parastation with the following
  contents:

  -------------------- snip --------------------
  #
  # ParaStation daemon
  #
  service psid
  {
        disable         = no
        socket_type     = stream
        wait            = no
        user            = root
        server          = /opt/parastation/bin/psid
        server_args     =
        log_on_failure  += USERID
  }
  #
  # ParaStation license server
  #
  service psld
  {
        disable         = no
        socket_type     = stream
        wait            = no
        user            = root
        server          = /opt/parastation/bin/psld
        server_args     =
        log_on_failure  += USERID
  }
  -------------------- snip --------------------

  Now, the xinetd daemon must be triggered to read this file:

	/etc/init.d/xinetd reload

6. ParaStation Configuration

  [If another version of ParaStation was installed before, you may
  want to make a backup of your old configuration file parastation.conf
  in the directory /opt/parastation/config.]

  Now copy the ParaStation configuration template parastation.conf.tmpl
  in /opt/parastation/config to  parastation.conf (in the same directory) and
  edit it following the hints given there.


7. Testing

  If everything went fine, you are ready to test ParaStation now. On
  one of the nodes do

	/opt/parastation/bin/psiadmin -c "s all"

  and repeat this command until all nodes are up.
