1. Starting of psmon deamon:

This applucation can be started on any host of a cluster or cluster's front-end host, because this application requires
the connection to psid deamon. Now this is possible only on the same host.

psmon {-hHOST} {-pPORT} {-d}
         |         |      |
         |         |      +-- this options requires stating with program as a trivial application for debug perposes
         |         +--------- the port, at which the server socket will be created (default value is 8888)
         +------------------- the host, at which the server socket will be created (default value is "localhost")
	 
	 
2. Requirements for java runtime envinronment
The jdk(tm) SE at list 1.3.1 is recommended, because all classes is compiled for this version of jdk(tm). This jdk(tm) can be 
downloaded from site java.sun.com for a different plathforms without any restrictions. The application requires most of a 
standard libraries (inc. SWING(tm)). The CLASSPATH variable must contain the path to rt.jar and to PSView.jar packages according 
java guides of Sun(tm).

3. Starting the java part (PSView)
java PSView -h HOST -p PORT
               |         |
               |         +--------- the port, at which the psmon's server socket started
               +------------------- the host, at which the psmon's server socket started
