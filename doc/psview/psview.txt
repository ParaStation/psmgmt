1. Starting of psmon deamon:

This applucation can be started on any host of a cluster or cluster's front-end host, because this application requires
the connection to psid deamon. Now this is possible only on the same host.

psmon {-h HOST} {-p PORT} {-d} { -t sec} { -T sec} { -w sec}
         |         |       |       |         |         |  
         |         |       |       |         |         |           
         |         |       |       |         |         +-- time period for waiting for cold regime                                                                              
         |         |       |       |         |             MINIMAL value is 1 sec, DEFAULT VALUE is 2 sec.
         |         |       |       |         |          										
         |         |       |       |         |           							
         |         |       |       |         +-- time period of sleeping for scanning values for cold
         |         |       |       |             regime (MINIMAL VALUE is 1 sec, DEFAULT VALUE is 10 sec [see 1.1.1].
         |         |       |       |         		    
         |         |       |       +--  time period of sleeping for scanning values for hot
         |         |       |            regime (MINIMAL VALUE is 1 sec, DEFAULT VALUE is MINIMAL) [see 1.1.1].          
         |         |       |         
         |         |       |       
         |         |       |
         |         |       +-- this options requires stating of this program as a trivial application for debug perposes
         |         +--------- the port, at which the server socket will be created (default value is 8888)
         +------------------- the host, at which the server socket will be created (default value is INADDR_ANY)
	 
	 
1.1. Data collecting regimes of psmon.
So, psmon collects information about cluster permanently. There are two regimes of psmon, which are named "hot" and "cold". 
If psmon has one or more active connection(s), "hot" regime is enabled, otherwise  psmon switchs itself to "cold" regime
in time waiting ("w" parameters of command line). The time periods of scanning parameters can be determined with help of
options -t for "hot" regime, and with help of options -T for "cold" regime.

	 
2. Requirements for java runtime envinronment
The jdk(tm) SE at list 1.3.1 is recommended, because all classes is compiled for this version of jdk(tm). This jdk(tm) can be 
downloaded from site java.sun.com for a different plathforms without any restrictions. The application requires most of a 
standard libraries (inc. SWING(tm)). The CLASSPATH variable must contain the path to rt.jar and to PSView.jar packages according 
Java(tm) guides of Sun(tm).

3. Starting the java part (PSView)
java PSView -h HOST -p PORT -tst sec
               |         |      |
               |         |	+--- the time period of information refreshing [see 3.1]      
               |         +---------- the port, at which the psmon's server socket started
               +-------------------- the host, at which the psmon's server socket started

3.1. The order of refreshing information in GUI.
The time of rescan for recieving of new information from psmon in GUI (parameter -tst) can not be less than time 
of rescan of psmon in "hot" regime (parameter -t). If user put value, which are less then time period of psmon, this
value will be changed to "time period of psmon + 1"
