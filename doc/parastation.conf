# Default HW-Type. All nodes have this HW (unless otherwise stated).
# Possible values are names from the Hardware section and 'none'.
# This has to be declared before any Node
#
# You can configure single HW with lines like:
# HWType myrinet
#
HWType	{ ethernet p4sock }

#
# (Dis-)Allow to start parallel jobs from all nodes (unless otherwise stated).
#
starter	yes

# (Dis-)Allow to run parallel jobs on all nodes (unless otherwise stated).

# List of all nodes
#
Nodes {
# Node 0 (which is the machine with hostname 'node-0') uses the default values
# for HWType, starter and runJobs which where declared above.

# Don't allow the start of parallel jobs from node 3 (on 'node-3').

# Node 5 (on 'node-5') has only ethernet communication hardware.

# Node 8 (on frontend) has no communication-hardware.

# DeadInterval	10

# The destination of the logging output of the daemon. Possible values are:
# LOG_DAEMON, LOG_KERN, LOG_LOCAL[0-7]
#
# LogDestination	LOG_DAEMON

# Use MCast for status control. The default is not to use MCast.

# The port to use within the RDP facility of the daemon

#
# Should resources of suspended parallel application be freed
# temporarily? The default is not to free resources. The following
# keyword is used to get them freed.
# Furthermore you can modify the behaviour during run-time via psiadmin's
# 'set freeOnSuspend' directive.
#
# freeOnSuspend
#
# Should applications linked against version of ParaStation prior than
# 4.1 be handled gracefully? The default is to ignore the resources
# occupated by old binaries. This might lead to unwanted overbooking
# of resources. The following keyword is used to handle them
# correctly.  Unfortunately the correct handling of old binaries
# interferes with the temporarily freeing of suspended job's resources.
#
# handleOldBins
