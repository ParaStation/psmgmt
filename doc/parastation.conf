# This script is called during startup of the ParaStation
# daemon. Depending on its return value the daemon continues startup
# without any action (0), some output of the script is written to the
# daemons log (-1) or the daemon stops immediately (-2).
#
# As a default no script is defined and, thus, nothing is called.
#
# startupScript	"scripts/psidStartup"

#
# This script is called by the currently elected master of the
# ParaStation daemons every time a node becomes active from
# ParaStation's point of view. I.e. the node's daemon connects to
# the master daemon for the first time after being down.
#
# This might be used to pass this type of information into a
# batch-system or some monitoring facility like the GridMonitor.
#
# While calling the script two additional arguments are passed within the
# environment:
#
# - NODE_NAME: The hostname of the node that appeared. The actual
# value is the IP address implicitly defined in the Nodes-section of
# this file resolved to the official name of the host using
# gethostbyaddr().
#
# - NODE_ID: The ParaStation ID of the node that appeared.
#
# As a default no script is defined and, thus, nothing is called.
#
# nodeUpScript	"scripts/psidNodeUp"

#
# This script is called by the currently elected master of the
# ParaStation daemons every time a node goes down from ParaStation's
# point of view. I.e. the node's daemon disconnects from the master
# daemon after being connected.
#
# This might be used to pass this type of information to a
# batch-system or some monitoring facility like the GridMonitor.
#
# While calling the script two additional arguments are passed within the

#
# Timeout of the RDP status module. After this number of milli-seconds
# a RDP-ping is sent to the master daemon. Additionally, the master
# daemon checks for received ping-messages. Within the daemon, there
# is a lower limit for all timeout-timers of 100 msec. Thus, the
# minimal value here is 100, too.
#
# Only relevant, if MCast is *not* used.
#
# StatusTimeout 2000
#
# Set the maximum number of status broadcasts per round. This is used
# to limit the number of status-broadcasts per status-iteration. Too
# many broadcast might lead to running out of message-buffers within
# RDP on huge clusters.
#
# If more than this number of broadcasts are triggered during one
# status-iteration, all future broadcasts will be ignored. The
# corresponding counter is reset upon start of the next status
# iteration.
#
# A value of 0 will completely suppress sending of
# status-broadcasts. In this case information on dead nodes will be
# propagated by sending ACTIVENODES messages upon receive of too many
# wrong LOAD messages, only.
#
# Only relevant, if MCast is *not* used.
#
# StatusBroadcasts 8
#
# Dead-limit of the RDP status module. After this number of
# consecutively missing RDP-pings the master declares the node to be
# dead. Only relevant, if MCast is *not* used.
#
# DeadLimit 5

#
# Use MCast for status control. The default is to *not* use MCast.

# The port to use within the RDP facility of the daemon
#
# RDPPort	886
#
# The timeout of the actual timer registered by RDP in
# milli-seconds. Each time the corresponding timer is elapsed,
# handleTimeoutRDP() is called handling all resend activities
# necessary. This parameter steers the actual load introduced by RDP.
# Within the daemon, there is a lower limit for all timeout-timers of
# 100 msec. Thus, the minimal value here is 100, too.
#
# RDPTimeout	100
#
# The maximum number of retransmissions within the RDP facility. If
# more than this number of retransmission would have been necessary to
# deliver the packet to the remote destination, this connection is
# declared to be down.
#
# RDPMaxRetrans	32
#
# The resend timeout within the RDP facility in milli-seconds. If a
# pending message is available and not yet acknowledged, this is the
# timeout after which the message is retransmitted to the remote host.
#
# RDPResendTimeout	300
#
# The closed timeout within the RDP facility in milli-seconds. If a
# RDP-connection is closed, during this timeout all messages from the
# corresponding partner are ignored. Thus, reconnection is avoided
# during this period. This helps handling packets still on the wire on
# connection close.
#
# RDPClosedTimeout	2000
#
# The maximum number of pending ACKs within the RDP facility. If this
# number of packets is received from a remote node consecutively
# without any retransmission, an explicit ACK is sent. Otherwise the
# ACK is sent piggyback within the next regular packet to this node or
# as soon as a retransmission occurred.
#
# If set to 1, each RDP packet received is acknowledged by an explicit
# ACK.
#
# RDPMaxACKPending	4
#
# Flag the RDP statistics. If set to 1, statistics on total number of
# messages sent and mean-time to ACK are determined per
# connection. Results can be retrieved via psiadmin's 'list rdp'
# directive.
#
# RDPStatistics	0
#
# Should resources of suspended parallel application be freed
# temporarily? The default is not to free resources. The following
# keyword is used to get them freed.
# Furthermore you can modify the behavior during run-time via psiadmin's
# 'set freeOnSuspend' directive.
#
# freeOnSuspend
#
# Should applications linked against version of ParaStation prior than
# 4.1 be handled gracefully? The default is to ignore the resources
# occupied by old binaries. This might lead to unwanted over-booking
# of resources. The following keyword is used to handle them
# correctly.  Unfortunately the correct handling of old binaries
# interferes with the temporarily freeing of suspended job's resources.
# Furthermore you can modify the behavior during run-time via psiadmin's
# 'set handleOldBins' directive.
#
# handleOldBins
#
# Define the default sorting strategy for nodes when attaching them to
# a partition. Possible values are PROC, LOAD1, LOAD5, LOAD15,
# PROC+LOAD or NONE.
# This only comes into play, if the user does not define a sorting
# strategy explicitely via PSI_NODES_SORT. Be aware of the fact the
# using a batch-system like PBS or LSF *will* set the strategy
# explicitely, namely to NONE.
# Furthermore you can modify the behavior during run-time via psiadmin's
# 'set nodesSort' directive.
#
# PSINodesSort proc
#
# In order to retrieve more detailed accounting information the
# forwarders might poll on /proc. This sets the poll interval in
# seconds. If Set to 0, no polling at all will take place.
#
# accountPoll	0
#
# Set the resource limit 'core' for the daemon process and all its
# children to the given value. If set to 0, no core-dumps will be
# created at all. If set to 'unlimited', there will be no restriction
# on the size of core-dump files. The default is to not touch the
# resource limit.
#
# RLimit Core unlimited
#

# Set the current working directory of the daemon process. This
# directory will be used to store core-dumps in the un-probable case of
# segmentation faults within the daemon. This option is mostly for
# debugging purposes.
# If 'coreDirectory' is explicitely set and 'RLimit Core' was not set
# before within this file, 'RLimit Core' is set to 'unlimited'.
