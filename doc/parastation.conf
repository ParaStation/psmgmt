# Configuration of the ParaStation daemon process (psid)

#
# Daemons are declared dead if this amount of MCast pings are missing
#
# DeadInterval	10
#
# The initial logging mask of the daemon
#
# LogMask	0
#
# The destination of the logging output of the daemon. Possible values are:
# LOG_DAEMON, LOG_KERN, LOG_LOCAL[0-7]
#
# LogDestination	LOG_DAEMON
#
# Use MCast for status control. The default is to not use MCast.
#
# UseMCast
#
# The MCast-group to use within the MCast facility of the daemon
#
# MCastGroup	237
#
# The port to use within the MCast facility of the daemon
#
# MCastPort	1889
#
# The port to use within the RDP facility of the daemon
#
# RDPPort	886
#
# The maximum number of retransmissions within the RDP facility. If
# more than this number of retransmission would have been necessary to
# deliver the packet to the remote destination, this connection is
# declared to be down.
#
# RDPMaxRetrans	32
#
# The maximum number of pending ACKs within the RDP facility. If this
# number of packets is received from a remote node consecutively
# without any retransmission, an explicit ACK is sent. Otherwise the
# ACK is sent piggyback within the next regular packet to this node or
# as soon as a retransmission occurred.
#
# If set to 1, each RDP packet received is acknowledged by an explicit
# ACK.
#
# RDPMaxACKPending	4
#
# Should resources of suspended parallel application be freed
# temporarily? The default is not to free resources. The following
# keyword is used to get them freed.
# Furthermore you can modify the behavior during run-time via psiadmin's
# 'set freeOnSuspend' directive.
#
# freeOnSuspend
#
# Should applications linked against version of ParaStation prior than
# 4.1 be handled gracefully? The default is to ignore the resources
# occupied by old binaries. This might lead to unwanted overbooking
# of resources. The following keyword is used to handle them
# correctly.  Unfortunately the correct handling of old binaries
# interferes with the temporarily freeing of suspended job's resources.
# Furthermore you can modify the behavior during run-time via psiadmin's
# 'set handleOldBins' directive.
#
# handleOldBins
#
# Define the default sorting strategy for nodes when attaching them to
# a partition. Possible values are PROC, LOAD1, LOAD5, LOAD15,
# PROC+LOAD or NONE.
# This only comes into play, if the user does not define a sorting
# strategy explicitely via PSI_NODES_SORT. Be aware of the fact the
# using a batch-system like PBS or LSF *will* set the strategy
# explicitely, namely to NONE.
# Furthermore you can modify the behavior during run-time via psiadmin's
# 'set nodesSort' directive.
#
# PSINodesSort proc
#
# In order to retrieve more detailed accounting information the
# forwarders might poll on /proc. This sets the poll interval in
# seconds. If Set to 0, no polling at all will take place.
#
# accountPoll	0
#
# Set the resource limit 'core' for the daemon process and all its
# children to the given value. If set to 0, no core-dumps will be
# created at all. If set to 'unlimited', there will be no restriction
# on the size of core-dump files. The default is to not touch the
# resource limit.
#
# RLimit Core unlimited
#

# Set the current working directory of the daemon process. This
# directory will be used to store core-dumps in the un-probable case of
# segmentation faults within the daemon. This option is mostly for
# debugging purposes.
# If 'coreDirectory' is explicitely set and 'RLimit Core' was not set
# before within this file, 'RLimit Core' is set to 'unlimited'.
#
# coreDirectory /tmp
