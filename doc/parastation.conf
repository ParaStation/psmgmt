# You have to declare this before any Nodes
#

#
# Default HW-Type. All nodes have this HW (unless otherwise stated).
# Possible values are 'ethernet', 'myrinet', 'gigaethernet' and 'none'.
# This has to be declared before any 'Node
#
# You can configure multiple HW with lines like:
# HWType { myrinet ethernet }
#
HWType	none
