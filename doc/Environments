Variable	possible values
--------------	----------------
PSI_EXPORTS	VAR[,VAR]
	List of environment variables which should be exported to 
	remote processes during spawning.

PSI_NODES_SORT	ROUNDROBIN
	No sorting of nodes before a spawn request. The nodes are used
	in round robin fashion as they are set in PSI_NODES,
	PSI_HOSTFILE or PSI_HOSTS
		NONE
	Like ROUNDROBIN
		LOAD
	The nodes are sorted by load before new processes are
	spawned. Therefore nodes with the least load are used first.
		PROC
	The nodes are sorted by the number of running ParaStation
	processes before new processes are spawnde. This is the
	default behavior.

PSI_NODES	number[,number..]
	Partition on which new processes should be spawned
	on. Depending on the variable PSI_NODES_SORT the ordering may
	be relevant. If the number of processes exceed the number of
	nodes in the partition some nodes may have more than one process.

PSI_HOSTFILE	filename
	Set the filename of a file, where hostnames of the nodes are
	listed which should be used for spawning. Similar to PSI_NODES
	but with names instead of logical ParaStation node numbers. If
	PSI_NODES is set too, it is dominant over PSI_HOSTFILE.
	s.o. PSI_NODES and PSI_HOSTS

PSI_HOSTS	hostname [hostname..]
	Space separted list of hostnames on which new processes should
	be spawned on.
	s.o. PSI_NODES and PSI_HOSTFILE

PSI_RARG_PRE_{n}
	Preceding arguments for remote processes. For example:
	PSI_RARG_PRE_0=/usr/bin/time to execute:
	/usr/bin/time yourApplication yourArgs
	on remote.

PSI_NOMSGLOGGERDONE	any
	Do not print out the message "PSPLogger done" at the end of a
	parallel run.

PSI_LOGGERDEBUG
	debug output for the psilogger.
PSI_FORWARDERDEBUG
	debug output for the psiforwarder.
PSI_SOURCEPRINTF
	prepend the initiator of outputs (psilogger)





MPICH:

Variable	possible values
--------------	----------------
MPID_PSP_MAXSMALLMSG	number
	Length (in bytes) of the largest message sent w/o rendezvous.

MPID_PSP_START	SSH
	Start remote processes with ssh. MPID_PSP_HOSTS must be set.
		PSID
	Start remote processes with the ParaStation start mechanism.
		NONE
	Dont start the remote processes. The remote processes must be
	started manualy. A commandline template is printed to stdout.

MPID_PSP_HOSTS	hostname[,hostname..]
	Comma separated list of hostnames. Used for MPID_PSP_START=SSH
	only.
