  <title>What is &ps;</title>
  <para>
    &ps; is a high speed communication subsystem, which is used to cluster
    standard workstations and PCs. A high speed interconnect enables you to use
    your cluster as a parallel computer. Communication is done via an
    additional parallel communication network card, e.g. MyriNet or gigabit
    Ethernet, and does not involve any Operating System communication paths.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    &ps; offers different interfaces to the communication subsystem. Beside the
    proprietary port interface (aka PSPort), it offers an emulation of Unix
    sockets. In addition common programming environments, such as MPI or Java
    RMI run on top of these interfaces.
  </para>

  <para>
    Besides another version called  ParaStation FE exists. This variant of &ps;
    uses Ethernet for communication in a only slightly optimized way and thus
    cannot give the high throughput, low latency communication one is used to
    from the MyriNet version. Nevertheless some disadvantages of the MPIch
    communication implementations are eliminated doubling the throughput for
    big packets (i.e. larger than 32 kByte).
  </para>

  <para>
    On the other hand &ps; offers an integrated cluster administration and
    cluster management environment. Using Unix daemon processes an effective
    resource management and single point of administration is implemented. This
    results in a single system image view of the cluster to deal with.
  </para>

  <para>
    From the user point of view cluster management leads to an easier and more
    effective usage of the cluster. Due to load balancing, job control and
    input/output management implemented by &ps;, almost all features nowaday
    clusters lack in comparison to classical supercomputers are now also
    available on clusters.

  <title>The history of &ps;</title>
  <para>
    The foundations of the &ps; software were laid in 1995, when the &ps;
    communication hardware and software system was presented. it was developed
    at the chair of Professor Tichy at computer science department of Karlsruhe
    University. Thus in the early days the &ps; project was mainly a hardware
    project.
  </para>
  <para>
    This changed when in 1998 ParaStation2 was presented, now a pure software
    project. The communication platform used then was MyriNet, a gigabit
    interconnect developed  by <ulink url="http://www.myri.com">
      MyriCom</ulink>. The development of ParaStation2 still took place at the
    University of Karlsruhe.
  </para>
  <para>
    &ps; became commercial in 1999 when <ulink
      url="http://www.par-tec.com">ParTec AG</ulink> was founded. This spin-off
    of Karlsruhe University now owns all rights and patent connected with the
    &ps; software. ParTec promoted the further development and improvement of
    the software. This includes the support of a broader basis of supported
    processor types, communication interconnect and operating systems.
