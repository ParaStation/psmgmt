  <title>What is &ps;</title>
  <para>
    <!--fg: allgemeiner --> 
    &ps; is an integrated cluster management and communication solution. 
    It combines unique features only found in &ps; with
    techniques, widely used in high performance computing,
    to deliver an integrated, easy to use and
    reliable compute cluster environment.
  </para>
<!--
  <para>
    &ps; is at first a high speed communication subsystem, which is used to
    cluster standard workstations and PCs. A high speed interconnect enables
    you to use your cluster as a parallel computer. Communication is done via
    an additional parallel communication network card, e.g. Myrinet or Gigabit
    Ethernet, and does not involve any Operating System communication paths.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    &ps; offers different interfaces to the communication subsystem. Beside the
    proprietary port interface (aka PSPort), it offers an emulation of BSD
    sockets. In addition common programming environments, such as MPI or Java
    RMI run on top of these interfaces.
  </para>

  <para>
  	The version 4 of &ps; supports different communication technologies as
		interconnect network.
    This version also comes with an
    optimized communication protocol and enables Ethernet to play a new role
    in the market of high throughput, low latency communication.  Beside the
    protocol enhancements, &ps4; eliminates some disadvantages of the MPIch
    communication implementations, thus doubling the throughput for large
    packets.
  </para>
<!--
  <para>
    At this time two different versions of &ps; are available. Besides the
    well known &ps3; software only using the Myrinet high speed communication
    interconnect there is a newer variant of &ps; supporting different network
    technologies as interconnect network: &ps4; This version comes with an
    optimized communication protocol and enables Ethernet to play a new role
    in the market of high throughput, low latency communication.  Beside the
    protocol enhancements, &ps4; eliminates some disadvantages of the MPIch
    communication implementations, thus doubling the throughput for large
    packets.
  </para>
  <para>
    This document describes installation, configuration and administration
    of &ps4;.  Previous versions of &ps;, especially &ps3; and &psfe;, are
    not covered by this document. Informations about this outdated versions
    can be found in previous versions of this document.
  </para>
-->

  <para>
		Like previous versions, &ps4; includes an integrated cluster
    administration and cluster management environment. Using communicating daemon
    processes on each cluster node an effective resource management and single
    point of administration is implemented. This results in a single system
    image view of the cluster.  
  </para>

  <para>
    All variants of the &ps; software offer an integrated cluster
    administration and cluster management environment. Using linked daemon
    processes on each cluster node an effective resource management and single
    point of administration is implemented. This results in a single system
    image view of the cluster.

  <para>
    From the users point of view this cluster management leads to an easier and more
    effective usage of the cluster. Important features like load balancing, job control and
    input/output management,
    common in classical supercomputers, but rarely found in compute clusters, 
		are implemented by &ps; and now also available on clusters.

    From the users point of view cluster management leads to an easier and more
    effective usage of the cluster. Due to load balancing, job control and
    input/output management implemented by &ps;, almost all features nowaday
    clusters lack in comparison to classical supercomputers are now also
    available on clusters.

  <title>The history of &ps;</title>
  <para>
    The fundamentials of the &ps; software were laid in 1995, when the &ps;
    communication hardware and software system was presented. It was developed
    at the chair of Professor Tichy at computer science department of Karlsruhe
    University.
  </para>
  <para>
    When in 1998 &ps;2 was presented, it was a pure software project. The
    communication platform used then was Myrinet, a gigabit interconnect
    developed  by <ulink url="http://www.myri.com"> Myricom</ulink>. The
    development of &ps;2 still took place at the University of Karlsruhe.
  </para>
  <para>
    &ps; became commercial in 1999 when <ulink
      url="http://www.par-tec.com">ParTec AG</ulink> was founded. This spin-off
    from the University of Karlsruhe now owns all rights and patents connected
    with the &ps; software. ParTec promotes the further development and
    improvement of the software. This includes the support of a broader basis
    of supported processor types, communication interconnect and operating
    systems.
  </para>
  <para>
    Version 3 of the &ps; software for Myrinet is a rewrite from
    scratch now fully in the responsibility of ParTec. All the
    know-how and experiences achieved from the former versions of the
    software were incorporated into this version. It was presented in
    2001 and was a major breakthrough in respect to throughput,
    latency and stability of the software. Nevertheless it is enhanced
    constantly in respect to performance, stability and usability.
  </para>
  <para>
    In 2002 the &psfe; software was presented opening the &ps; software
    environment towards Ethernet communication hardware. This first step in the
    direction of independence from the underlying communication hardware
    brought the convenient &ps; management facility to beowulf clusters for the
    first time. Furthermore the suboptimal communication performance for large
    packets gained from the MPIch/P4 implementation of the MPI message passing
    interface, the de facto standard on beowulf clusters, was improved to the
    limits that are to be expected from the physical circumstances.
  </para>
  <para>
    With &ps4; presented in 2003 the software became really communication
    platform independent. With this version of the software even Gigabit
    Ethernet became a serious alternative as a cluster interconnect due to the
    throughput and latency that could be achieved.
