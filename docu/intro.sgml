  <title>What is &ps;</title>
  <para>
    &ps; is at first a high speed communication subsystem, which is used to
    cluster standard workstations and PCs. A high speed interconnect enables
    you to use your cluster as a parallel computer. Communication is done via
    an additional parallel communication network card, e.g. Myrinet or Gigabit
    Ethernet, and does not involve any Operating System communication paths.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    &ps; offers different interfaces to the communication subsystem. Beside the
    proprietary port interface (aka PSPort), it offers an emulation of BSD
    sockets. In addition common programming environments, such as MPI or Java
    RMI run on top of these interfaces.
  </para>

  <para>
    At the time three different versions of &ps; exist. Besides the well known
    &ps3; software using the Myrinet high speed communication interconnect
    there are two further variants running on top of Ethernet: On the one hand
    a version called &psfe; running on top of TCP/IP, on the other hand &ps4;
    which runs an optimized protocol and enables Ethernet to play a role in the
    market of high throughput, low latency communication. While both versions
    running on Ethernet eliminate some disadvantages of the MPIch communication
    implementations doubling the throughput for big packets (i.e. larger than
    32 kByte), &psfe; obviously cannot give the same performance as &ps4; due
    to the complete different communication architecture.
  </para>

  <para>
    All variants of the &ps; software offer an integrated cluster
    administration and cluster management environment. Using Unix daemon
    processes an effective resource management and single point of
    administration is implemented. This results in a single system image view
    of the cluster to deal with.
  </para>

  <para>
    From the users point of view cluster management leads to an easier and more
    effective usage of the cluster. Due to load balancing, job control and
    input/output management implemented by &ps;, almost all features nowaday
    clusters lack in comparison to classical supercomputers are now also
    available on clusters.

  <title>The history of &ps;</title>
  <para>
    The foundations of the &ps; software were laid in 1995, when the &ps;
    communication hardware and software system was presented. It was developed
    at the chair of Professor Tichy at computer science department of Karlsruhe
    University.
  </para>
  <para>
    When in 1998 &ps;2 was presented, it was a pure software project. The
    communication platform used then was Myrinet, a gigabit interconnect
    developed  by <ulink url="http://www.myri.com"> Myricom</ulink>. The
    development of &ps;2 still took place at the University of Karlsruhe.
  </para>
  <para>
    &ps; became commercial in 1999 when <ulink
      url="http://www.par-tec.com">ParTec AG</ulink> was founded. This spin-off
    from the University of Karlsruhe now owns all rights and patents connected
    with the &ps; software. ParTec promoted the further development and
    improvement of the software. This includes the support of a broader basis
    of supported processor types, communication interconnect and operating
    systems.
  </para>
  <para>
    Version 3 of the &ps; software for Myrinet is a rewrite from scratch now
    fully in the responsibility of ParTec. Of course all the know-how and
    experiences gained from the former versions of the software flowed into
    this version. It was presented in 2001 and was a major breakthrough in
    respect to throughput, latency and stability of the software. Nevertheless
    it is enhanced constantly in respect to performance, stability and
    usability.
  </para>
  <para>
    In 2002 the &psfe; software was presented opening the &ps; software
    environment towards Ethernet communication hardware. This first step in the
    direction of independence from the underlying communication hardware
    brought the convenient &ps; management facility to beowulf clusters for the
    first time. Furthermore the suboptimal communication performance for large
    packets gained from the MPIch/P4 implementation of the MPI message passing
    interface, the de facto standard on beowulf clusters, was improved to the
    limits that are to be expected from the physical circumstances.
  </para>
  <para>
    With &ps4; presented in 2003 the software became really communication
    platform independent. With this version of the software even Gigabit
    Ethernet became a serious alternative as a cluster interconnect due to the
    throughput and latency that could be achieved.
