    ParaStation is a high speed communication subsystem, which is used to
    cluster standard workstations and PCs. A high speed interconnect enables
    you to use your cluster as a parallel computer. Communication is done via
    an additional parallel communication network card, e.g. MyriNet or gigabit
    Ethernet, and does not involve any Operating System communication paths.

  <para>
    ParaStation offers different interfaces to the communication subsystem.
    Beside the proprietary interface of Ports, it offers an emulation of the
    Unix sockets. In addition common programming environments, such as MPI or
    Java RMI run on top of these interfaces.
