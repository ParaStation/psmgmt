  <title>What is &ps;</title>
  <para>
    &ps; is at first a high speed communication subsystem, which is used to
    cluster standard workstations and PCs. A high speed interconnect enables
    you to use your cluster as a parallel computer. Communication is done via
    an additional parallel communication network card, e.g. Myrinet or gigabit
    Ethernet, and does not involve any Operating System communication paths.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    &ps; offers different interfaces to the communication subsystem. Beside the
    proprietary port interface (aka PSPort), it offers an emulation of Unix
    sockets. In addition common programming environments, such as MPI or Java
    RMI run on top of these interfaces.
  </para>

  <para>
    Furthermore another version called &psfe; exists. This variant of &ps; uses
    Ethernet for communication in an optimized way but cannot give the high
    throughput, low latency communication one is used to from the Myrinet
    version due to the limited potential provided by Ethernet. Additionally
    some disadvantages of the MPIch communication implementations are
    eliminated doubling the throughput for big packets (i.e. larger than 32
    kByte).
  </para>

  <para>
    In addition &ps; offers an integrated cluster administration and cluster
    management environment. Using Unix daemon processes an effective resource
    management and single point of administration is implemented. This results
    in a single system image view of the cluster to deal with.
  </para>

  <para>
    From the users point of view cluster management leads to an easier and more
    effective usage of the cluster. Due to load balancing, job control and
    input/output management implemented by &ps;, almost all features nowaday
    clusters lack in comparison to classical supercomputers are now also
    available on clusters.

  <title>The history of &ps;</title>
  <para>
    The foundations of the &ps; software were laid in 1995, when the &ps;
    communication hardware and software system was presented. It was developed
    at the chair of Professor Tichy at computer science department of Karlsruhe
    University.
  </para>
  <para>
    When in 1998 ParaStation2 was presented, it was a pure software project.
    The communication platform used then was Myrinet, a gigabit interconnect
    developed  by <ulink url="http://www.myri.com"> MyriCom</ulink>. The
    development of ParaStation2 still took place at the University of
    Karlsruhe.
  </para>
  <para>
    &ps; became commercial in 1999 when <ulink
      url="http://www.par-tec.com">ParTec AG</ulink> was founded. This spin-off
    from the University of Karlsruhe now owns all rights and patent connected
    with the &ps; software. ParTec promoted the further development and
    improvement of the software. This includes the support of a broader basis
    of supported processor types, communication interconnect and operating
    systems.
