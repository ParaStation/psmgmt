    ParaStation is a high speed communication subsystem, which is used to
    cluster standard workstations and PCs. A high speed interconnect enables
    you to use your cluster as a parallel computer. Communication is done via
    an additional parallel communication network card, e.g. MyriNet or gigabit
    Ethernet, and does not involve any Operating System communication paths.

  <para>
    ParaStation offers different interfaces to the communication subsystem.
    Beside the proprietary interface of Ports, it offers an emulation of the
    Unix sockets. In addition common programming environments, such as MPI or
    Java RMI run on top of these interfaces.

  <para>
    Besides another version called  ParaStation FE exists. This variant of
    ParaStation uses Ethernet for communication in a only slightly optimized
    way and thus cannot give the high throughput, low latency communication one
    is used to from the MyriNet version. Nevertheless some disadvantages of the
    MPIch communication implementations are eliminated doubling the throughput
    for big packets (i.e. larger than 32 kByte). On the other hand all
    advantages conceerning cluster administration and cluster management are
    included in this version.

    This manual discusses installation and configuration of
    ParaStation. Furthermore the system management utilities are described.

    For a detailed discussion of the user utilities and the programming
    interfaces included in the standard distribution take a look at the
    ParaStation Users Guide.

  <para>
    This document describes version 3.2 of the ParaStation software for MyriNet
    and version 1.0 of ParaStation FE.
