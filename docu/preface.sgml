    ParaStation is a high speed communication subsystem, which is used to
    cluster standard workstations and PCs. This high speed interconnect
    enables you to use your cluster as a parallel computer. Communication is
    done via an additional parallel communication network card and does not
    involve any Operating System communication paths.

    ParaStation offers different interfaces to the communication
    subsystem. Beside the proprietary interface of Ports, it offers an
    emulation of the Unix sockets. In addition common programming
    environments, such as MPI run on top of these interfaces.
