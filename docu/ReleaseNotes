This is ParaStation3 version 3.3.

Changes from version 3.2:

- New and more flexible syntax within configuration file
- New daemon-daemon and application-daemon protocol.
- Better and more robust signal handling.
- New and more scalable output forwarding facilities.
- Per node limitation for user and number of processes.
- Many bug fixes.


If you upgrade from a version older version of ParaStation3, you have
to relink *all* your ParaStation aware application in order to enable
them to talk to the new daemon. This is due to the change in the
application daemon protocol. Hopefully this will be the last time you
have to do this.


Furthermore the syntax of the configuration file changed
significantly. The versions 3.3 daemon does not any longer understand
the old format. Thus you have to adapt your parastation.conf file to
the new syntax.

A good starting point in order to do this is the old configuration
file from your version 3.2 installation. It is a good idea to keep a
copy of your old configuration as a backup.

You have to change the following entries within this file (each change
this is only necessary, if the corresponding entry within the versions
3.2 configration file was not commented out):

- Set the InstallDir parameter to the one in the versions 3.2 file.

- Copy the "Hardware myrinet" definition from the new
  parastation.conf.templ file via cut and paste to your configuration
  file just after the InstallDir parameter. The definition consist of
  the actual "Hardware myrinet" line and all the stuff within the
  curly brackets.

- Within the "Hardware myrinet" definition, adapt the following parameters:
  - Set PS_ROUTEFILE to the value of the version 3.2 RoutingFile parameter.
  - Set PS_IPPREFIX to the value of the old IPPrefix parameter.
  - Set PS_IPPREFIXLEN to the value of the old IPPrefixLen parameter.
  - Set PS_SPS to the value of the old SmallPacketSize parameter.
  - Set PS_HNPEND to the value of the old HNPend parameter.
  - Set PS_ACKPEND to the value of the old ACKPend parameter.

- Set HWType to myrinet (literally).

- Remove the hasIP line (if any)

- Within the Nodes section, remove all hasIP entries.

- Remove the MyrinetModule, RoutingFile, SmallPacketSize,
  ResendTimeout, HNPend, ACKPend, IPModule, IPPrefix and IPPrefixLen
  parameters from your configuration.

Now you are done and you can test if the new daemon understands your
new configuration file. Start 'psiadmin'. It should prompt you soon
for any commands. If there is still no prompt after some seconds take
a look at the /var/log/messages file (or whereever your syslogd puts
its output to) in order to find out what is wrong with your setup.
