Requirements:
=============

The documentation is written in DocBook XML V4.2.

Validation and processing the PDF is done with OpenJade using DSSSL
Stylesheets. Used wrappers around OpenJade and JadeTeX are from
docbook-toys.

Processing of man-pages and HTML is done with xsltproc (from libxslt)
using the XSL Stylesheets.

The following versions were tested:

openjade 1.3.2
docbook-dsssl-stylesheets 1.77
docbook-toys 1.51.0
libxslt 1.0.26
docbook-xsl-stylesheets 1.60.1

Remark:
=======

All this stuff is from SuSE 8.2 and should run out of the box.

Only the docbook_4 package has to be updated to docbook_4-4.2-248 since
the pre/post scripts within the distribution are buggy: xsltproc will
not find the DocBook DTD. The corresponding rpm might be found in
 
ftp://ftp.suse.com:/pub/people/ke/8.2-i386/

A minor bug within the 1.60.1 stylesheets is fixed within html.xsl. This
bug is also fixed in 1.61.1. Thus the fix may be removed from html.xsl
as soon as this documentations is build with 1.61.1 or higher (SuSE 8.3 ?).

Alternative PDF generation:
===========================

There is a new way to generate PDFs via the FO stylesheets and FOP. This
should work with the stuff found on SuSE 9.1 almost out of the box. Only
two slight changes have to be made:

- The Jimi.jar file has to be added by hand as described in
  /usr/share/fop/lib/readme. This is needed for including .png files into
  the PDF.

- Since some stuff from the version 1.66.1 XSL stylesheets are use, these
  also have to be installed. The RPM can be found on:
  http://www.theorie.physik.uni-wuppertal.de/~eicker/XSL-RPMs

In order to enable this alternative way you have to change the pdf creation
lines in Makefile.in.
