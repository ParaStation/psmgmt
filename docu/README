Requirements:
i============

The documentation is written in DocBook XML V4.2.

Validation and processing is done with OpenJade using DSSSL Stylesheets.
Used wrappers around OpenJade and JadeTeX are:
* docbook-toys
* docbook2X

The following versions were tested:

openjade 1.3.1
docbook-dsssl-stylesheets 1.77
docbook-toys 0.61.0
docbook2X 0.70

Remark:
=======

These version are mostly *not* included in SuSE 8.0.
Most of the packets where taken from
ftp://ftp.suse.com:/pub/people/ke/8.0-i386/

The docbook2x paket from SuSE is totally broken! I had to build my
own rpm. You can find it in Wuppertal under ~eicker/scr/OwnRPMS.
