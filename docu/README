Requirements:
=============

The documentation is written in DocBook XML V4.2.

Validation is done via xmllint which is part of libxml2.

PDFs are created via OpenJade using DSSSL stylesheets and
JadeTeX. Used wrappers around OpenJade are from docbook-toys.

Processing of man-pages and HTML is done with xsltproc (from libxslt)
using the XSL stylesheets.

The following versions were tested:

openjade 1.3.2
docbook-dsssl-stylesheets 1.77
docbook-toys 1.51.0
libxslt 1.0.26
libxml2 2.5.3
docbook-xsl-stylesheets 1.60.1

Remark:
=======

All this stuff is from SuSE 8.2 and should run out of the box.

Only the docbook_4 package has to be updated to docbook_4-4.2-248 since
the pre/post scripts within the distribution are buggy: xsltproc will
not find the DocBook DTD. The corresponding rpm might be found in
 
ftp://ftp.suse.com:/pub/people/ke/8.2-i386/

A minor bug within the 1.60.1 stylesheets is fixed within html.xsl. This
bug is also fixed in 1.61.1. Thus the fix may be removed from html.xsl
as soon as this documentations is build with 1.61.1 or higher (SuSE 8.3 ?).

Alternative PDF generation:
===========================

There is a new way to generate PDFs via the FO part of the XSL
stylesheets and FOP. Once this way to create PDFs is mature we can
skip the dependencies towards OpenJade/JadeTeX/DSSSL/db2tex.

In order to enable this alternative way you have to change the pdf
creation lines in Makefile.in. Don't forget to run configure
afterwards.

The following versions were tested:

libxslt 1.0.32 (libxslt 1.0.26 from SuSE 8.2 does *not* work!)
libxml2 2.5.10
fop 0.20.5
docbook-xsl-stylesheets 1.66.1

This should work with the stuff found on SuSE 9.0 almost out of the
box. Only three slight changes have to be made:

- The FOP tool has to be installed. It can be found in 
  ftp.suse.com/pub/people/ke/9.0-i386
  This step is not needed on SuSE 9.1 since FOP is included.

- The Jimi.jar file has to be added by hand as described in
  http://xml.apache.org/fop/graphics.html#jimi.
  Jimi is needed for including .png files into the PDF.

- Since some stuff from the version 1.66.1 XSL stylesheets is used,
  these also have to be installed. The RPM can be found on:
