  <title>Building native &ps; applications</title>
  <para>
    This chapter describes briefly how to write native &ps; applications,
    i.e. application that make use of the &ps; low level communication
    libraries and the &ps; management facilities without utilizing the standard
    MPI libraries.
  </para>
  <para>
    In general it is not necessary to write native &ps; applications. Since the
    communication performance improvement from circumventing the high level MPI
    library is negligible, in almost any scenario the utilization of MPI is the
    recommended way. Additionally MPI guarantees the portability of the
    programs to be developed.

  <para>
    Nevertheless the source code of a simple application comes with the
    standard &ps; software distribution and may be found in the
    <filename>/opt/parastation/doc/examples</filename> directory. The file
    is named <filename>native.c</filename>.

  <para>
    As already mentioned the usage of the &ps; API is only discussed briefly. A
    detailed description may be found in the <ulink url="../api/index.html"
      type="dontshow">API reference</ulink>.

    <title>Using the PSPort interface</title>
    <para>
      In order to actually utilize low level &ps; communication interfaces the
      PSPort library has to be used. The PSPort library supplies fast and
      reliable point to point connections to the user. To make use of these
      connections, first of all a ...
