Full documentation can be found here:

### Run

1. Change to the directory where ReFrame should (and is allowed to)
   put all the stage and output files to. The subdirectories "stage"
   and "output" are created later automatically.

2. Point to the right configuration in your environment:

   $> export RFM_CONFIG_FILES=<your_config_file>

3. Run the tests:

   $> reframe -c <path_to_psmgmt_sources>/tests/reframe/PMIx/ -r
