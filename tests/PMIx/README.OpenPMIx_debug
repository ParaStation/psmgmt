In order to get debug messages from the library part of the host
server according preparations of OpenPMIx have to be made. The
simplest way seems to be to abuse the psid's environment for that.

Debug in OpenPMIx is configured based on its Modular Component
Architecture (MCA). Thus, debug might be configured for each
module. In order to explore the available knobs you can use:

pmix_info --param all all

Besides setting corresponding parameters in ~/.pmix/mca-params.conf
(on a per user basis) or in /etc/pmix/pmix-mca-params.conf (globally)
the possibility to utilize the environment of the corresponding
process exists. Variables of the form

PMIX_MCA_<variable_name>=<value>

will set the according MCA variable.

In the case of the host-server's library part an according output
destination must be defined. This can be achieved by setting
PMIX_OUTPUT_REDIRECT to 'file'. Thus, by e.g. setting a node's psid
environment via psiadmin to:

environment set PMIX_OUTPUT_REDIRECT file
environment set PMIX_MCA_pmix_server_base_verbose 3
environment set PMIX_MCA_pmix_server_get_verbose 8
environment set PMIX_MCA_gds_base_verbose 11
environment set PMIX_MCA_ptl_base_verbose 3

you'll enable pmix_server_base's verbosity to 3, pmix_server_get's
verbosity to 8, etc. and redirect all debug output into a file located
in /tmp. The filename will be like "pmix-output-pid18780-output.txt"
