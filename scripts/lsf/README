README for the LSF Parallel - MPICH-PSM Integration (for Linux)

Follow the instructions in the README of the MPICH-GM integration
(lsf/mpich-gm.linux2.4-glibc2.1-intel/README)
Replace gmmpirun_wrapper by the parastation wrapper
psm_lsf_wrapper. And esub from gm with the esub for parastation.
The -a option for bsub is mpich_psm instead of mpich_gm.

bsub -a mpich_psm -n 3 myjob
Or you can call:
bsub -n 3 pam -g 1 psm_lsf_wrapper myjob

===========================
1. Introduction
===========================
The LSF Parallel - MPICH-GM Integration allows LSF to launch, monitor,
and control mpi jobs which have been specially compiled to run in a Myrinet
cluster (ie. they use mpich-gm).

===========================
2. Assumptions
===========================

This integration assumes that the Myrinet cluster is a homogenious Linux
cluster.

This README assumes the following:

- You have knowledge of LSF and LSF Parallel. For more  details, refer to
  the LSF Parallel Guide.

======================================
3. Pre-installation Requirements
======================================

Before you install the LSF Parallel - MPICH-GM Integration, make sure you have
met the following requirements:

----------------------------------
MPICH-GM is installed
----------------------------------
See the Myricom web site at http://www.myrinet.com
For software distributions and documentation follow the link to
"Myrinet Software and Customer Support".

----------------------------------
LSF 4.2 or later is installed
----------------------------------
If it is not, download it from the Platform FTP site at ftp.platform.com: 

For 4.2: (choose Linux 2.2 or Linux 2.4)
- /distrib/4.2/standard/lsf4.2_standard_linux2.?-glibc2.1-x86.tar.Z

Access to the Platform FTP site is controlled by login name and password. 
If you are unable to access the distribution files, send email
to info@platform.com.

-------------------------------------------
LSF Parallel 4.2 or later is installed
-------------------------------------------
Make sure LSF Parallel for your LSF version is installed.

Install LSF Parallel 4.2
------------------------
1. Install LSF Standard Edition.

2. Download the LSF Parallel 4.2 from the Platform FTP site at ftp.platform.com: 
   - /distrib/4.2/parallel/lsf4.2_parallel_install.tar.Z
   - /distrib/4.2/parallel/lsf4.2_parallel_linux2.?-glibc.tar.Z

3. Uncompress and extract lsf4.2_parallel_install.tar.Z to the distribution 
   directory where you download the "lsf4.2_parallel_aix4.tar.Z".

4. Run lsf4.2_parallel_install/lsfinsparallel to install the LSF Parallel.
   See the LSF Reference Guide for information about lsfinstparallel and 
   its options.

======================================================
4. Installing the LSF Parallel - MPICH-GM Integration
======================================================

-----------------------------
4.1 mpich-gm.tar.Z 
-----------------------------

1. Download the LSF Parallel - MPICH-GM Integration tar file from the
Platform FTP site.

   The tar file contains the following files:
	- README (this file)
	- TaskStarter (binary)
        - pam (binary)
        - libpamvcl.so (shared library)
	- esub (script)
	- elim (script)
	- elim.user (script)
	- gmmpirun_wrapper (script)

----------------------------------------------------
4.2 Install the LSF Parallel - MPICH-GM Integration 
----------------------------------------------------

1. Log on to the LSF UNIX file server as root.


2. Extract the contents of the distribution file:

   # zcat mpich-gm.tar.Z | tar xvf -


3. Change to the distribution directory:

   # cd mpich-gm


4. Configure new custom resource called gm_ports.

   The Resource section of the lsf.shared file should resemble the following.

Begin Resource
RESOURCENAME  TYPE    INTERVAL INCREASING  DESCRIPTION        # Keywords
#
# other resources not shown
#
gm_ports      Numeric 30       N           (number of free gm ports)
End Resource

   The ResourceMap section of the lsf.cluster.<cluster_name> file should be
   modified to specify the location of the new resource.

Begin ResourceMap
RESOURCENAME  LOCATION
# 
# other resources not shown
# 
gm_ports      [default]
End ResourceMap

   Note: If the site has other custom resources they can no longer use an
   elim to directly report on these. They will use an elim.user script. The
   one provided in this package is an example on how to write one. The
   format of the elim.user is different from an ordinary elim script.
   The elim script provided with this package will call the elim.user
   script to obtain the information on the other custom resources.

5. Modifying the scripts

elim
----
The elim is used to report the number of free virtual ports available on a
host. The elim script makes use of the gm_board_info command. Edit the elim
to specify the full path to the command. Set the variable GM_BOARD_INFO_CMD
appropriately.

-----------------------------------
#!/bin/sh

GM_BOARD_INFO_CMD="/path/to/gm_board_info"
MAX_NUM_BOARDS="4"
EXCLUDE_PORTS="0 1 3"
...
-----------------------------------


gmmpirun_wrapper 
----------------
Similarly, the gmmpirun_wrapper script makes use of the gm_board_info
command. Edit the script to specify the full path to the command. Set
the variable GM_BOARD_INFO_CMD appropriately. Also this script will
use the mpirun command. Edit the script to specify the full path to the
command. Set the variable MPIRUN_CMD appropriately. This script creates
a configuration file (specifying hosts and ports) and then invokes the
mpirun command to start the parallel job.

-----------------------------------
#!/bin/sh

GM_BOARD_INFO_CMD="/path/to/gm_board_info"
MAX_NUM_BOARDS="4"

MPIRUN_CMD="/path/to/mpirun.ch_gm.in"
...
-----------------------------------


elim.user
---------
The elim.user script is only required if the cluster has custom resources
defined. The elim.user in this package is provided as an example. Note
that the format of the information reported by elim.user is not the same
as the format used by a regular elim.


6. Copy TaskStarter to $LSF_BINDIR
   Copy pam to $LSF_BINDIR
   Copy libpamvcl.so to $LSF_LIBDIR
   Copy elim to $LSF_SERVERDIR
   Copy elim.user to $LSF_SERVERDIR (optional)
   Copy esub to $LSF_SERVERDIR
   Copy gmmpirun_wrapper to $LSF_BINDIR

Note: Typically, each board in a host will have 8 ports, numbered 0 through 7.
      Ports 0, 1, and 3 are usually reserved for system use, and ports 2, 4,
      5, 6, and 7 are available for the user. In the elim and
      gmmpirun_wrapper scripts, ports 0, 1, and 3 are automaticaly excluded
      for consideration. This is controlled by the variable EXCLUDE_PORTS.
      Also it is assumed that a host will have 4 or fewer boards installed.
      This is controlled by the variable MAX_NUM_BOARDS.


===========================
5. Submitting MPICH-GM Jobs   
===========================

   To submit a MPICH-GM job use the bsub command. For example:

   bsub -a mpich_gm -n 3 myjob

   The '-a mpich_gm' indicates that this job submission is an MPICH-GM
   parallel job. The esub script recognizes this and modifies the
   submission so that it is equivalent to:

   bsub -n 3 -R "select[gm_ports>0] rusage[gm_ports=1:duration=30]" \
       pam -g 1 gmmpirun_wrapper myjob

   The user's job will be run on 3 hosts which have at least one free port.
