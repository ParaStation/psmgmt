Version 5.0.29:
===============

Bugfixes:
 - psh name merging will not merge (#317).
 - psh's NameCompress create empty result (#318).
 - Performance enhancement in RDP: msgbufs put back into pool
      earlier (jt:#3239).
 - Performance enhancement in flow-control: Don't always wait
      for Sselect to time-out (jt:#3239).

Enhancements:
 - use selectors to handle clients' file-descriptors in psid.
 - allow to trigger Sselect() to start-over. Useful to enable modified
      fd-sets more quickly. Might help with jt:#3239.
 - allow to disable registered selectors temporarily.
 - enable stack protector, if supported (#796).

Additional changes:
 - less important RDP-messages suppressed per default. These might
      lead to bandwidth-problems on huge clusters due to created load.
 - psh now uses psnameexpand and psnamecompress from pscluster/bin/pstool
 - Obsolete NrofNodes removed from default configuration


Version 5.0.28:
===============

Bugfixes:
 - Various improvements in RDP protocol (#386).
 - Fix possible race-condition when resequencing RDP messages (#327).
    this might lead to the behavior described in #327.
 - Improved startup of psid on huge cluster with few active nodes.
 - psaccview: option --norcfile doesn't need a parameter
 - psaccview: don't display empty lines when using option --nospace

Enhancements:
 - Improved logging from RDP's state-machine.
 - psaccview: new option --last_days to show the last x days of accounting data.
 - psaccview: new option --timeout will stop parsing if the timeout is reached.
 - Allow service-tasks to explicitely request signals on children's end (#554).

Additional changes:
 - If core-dumps are enabled, psid does not catch SIGBUS any longer.
 - Extended accounting functionality moved into plugin.
