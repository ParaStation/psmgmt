Version 5.0.31:
===============
Bugfixes:
 - Remove limitations on length of arguments when spawning processes (#740).
 - psiadmin now accept range of the form last-first, too (#1014).
 - Include RDP-header in maximum message size for protocols (#459).
 - Fix crippled output of very long lines since 5.0.30.
 - Fix memory leak in partition handling (#794).
 - Catch possible segfaults within psid's logging.
 - Prevent psid from segfaulting, if PSI_TPP erroneously set to 0.
 - Don't crash psid, if client<->daemon protocol is messed up.

Enhancements:
 - Unload plugins before daemon shuts down (#562).
 - RDP statistics (mean-time to ACK, etc.).
 - psh: fix precedence of $RCMD, $AUTOCD and $MAXRCMD.
 - Nicer output of long lines with and without prefixes.
 - Better error-message from mpiexec, if spawning of service-process failed.
 - More detailed messages on late receives in psilogger.
 - Improve testing on failed initialization of loggers.
 - Initialize timer facility explicitely (#799).

Additional changes:
 - Remove extra debug in context of #442.


Version 5.0.30:
===============
Bugfixes:
 - Improve memory-handling when temporarily buffering messages (#689/jt:#2686).
 - Mark psiadmin's hex-output to be in hex (#612).
 - Improved error-messages, if PMI barrier timeout strikes (#827).
 - Improve logging with timestamps (#719).

Enhancements:
 - New psiadmin directive: echo (#632).
 - RLIMIT_NOFILE now configurable & propagated to remote processes
   (#792/jt:#2691).
 - Better handling of hanging file-systems while spawning processes (#879).
 - psid's environment might be changed during runtime (#815).
 - Enhanced plugin-interface within psid (#562). This is a pre-requisit for
   psmom and psaccount plugins.
 - Job's starttime is listed in psiadmin's 'list jobs' directive.

Additional changes:
 - Improved logging on flaws in psid's configuration file.
 - Add /opt/parastation/sbin to root's PATH (#893).


Version 5.0.29:
===============

Bugfixes:
 - psh name merging will not merge (#317).
 - psh's NameCompress create empty result (#318).
 - Performance enhancement in RDP: msgbufs put back into pool
      earlier (jt:#3239).
 - Performance enhancement in flow-control: Don't always wait
      for Sselect to time-out (jt:#3239).

Enhancements:
 - use selectors to handle clients' file-descriptors in psid.
 - allow to trigger Sselect() to start-over. Useful to enable modified
      fd-sets more quickly. Might help with jt:#3239.
 - allow to disable registered selectors temporarily.
 - enable stack protector, if supported (#796).

Additional changes:
 - less important RDP-messages suppressed per default. These might
      lead to bandwidth-problems on huge clusters due to created load.
 - psh now uses psnameexpand and psnamecompress from pscluster/bin/pstool
 - Obsolete NrofNodes removed from default configuration


Version 5.0.28:
===============

Bugfixes:
 - Various improvements in RDP protocol (#386).
 - Fix possible race-condition when resequencing RDP messages (#327).
    this might lead to the behavior described in #327.
 - Improved startup of psid on huge cluster with few active nodes.
 - psaccview: option --norcfile doesn't need a parameter
 - psaccview: don't display empty lines when using option --nospace

Enhancements:
 - Improved logging from RDP's state-machine.
 - psaccview: new option --last_days to show the last x days of accounting data.
 - psaccview: new option --timeout will stop parsing if the timeout is reached.
 - Allow service-tasks to explicitely request signals on children's end (#554).

Additional changes:
 - If core-dumps are enabled, psid does not catch SIGBUS any longer.
 - Extended accounting functionality moved into plugin.
