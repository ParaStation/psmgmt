Version 5.0.37:
===============
Bugfixes:
 - Block SIGCHLD while doing syslog() in order to prevent psid from deadlocks.
   syslog() is not re-entrand! (JUDGE-TRAC #141)
 - Ensure, that all TASKDEAD-messages are delivered to new master-psid after
   failover. Additionally, don't tell new master about jobs currently shutting
   down.
 - Actually enable dumping of too-long messages tail. This completes the
   changes done in r8132.
 - Get rid of obsolete timer-entries after fork(). Might lead to strange
   behavior, if timer is pending during fork()
 - Connection to syslog has to be re-opened after cleanup for fork()
 - Selectors shall be removed when corresponding file-descriptor is closed.
 - Remove spurious TAB in output when talking to plugins (#1481).

Enhancements:
 - Prepare psiadmin to print-out hostnames instead of node IDs sometime (#490)

Additional changes:
 - Improve messages from psid's plugin-handling to psiadmin.
 - Include stub into test-plugin for extraordinary long help-messages.

Version 5.0.36:
===============
Bugfixes:

 - New type of timeout-handlers receiving the timer ID and additional
   information upon elapse (#1361)
 - sendSignal2Session() returns number of children signal was sent to
 - psid shall not block SIGCHLD most of the time. Instead, only critical
   code-regions are fenced by blocked SIGCHLD (#1333)

Version 5.0.35:
===============
Bugfixes:
 - Correct detection of psiadmin and mpiexec started from within scripts
   run via pssh (#1280)

Version 5.0.34:
===============

   request was encoded with false protocol-version.

Enhancements:

Enhancements:
 - Propagate PATH and LIBRARY_PATH environment automatically (#1173)
 - Add psaccount plugin providing advanced accounting functionality
 - More intuitive user-handling in configuration-file

Additional changes:

Version 5.0.32:
===============
Bugfixes:

 - Fix race-conditions that might lock RDP's timer forever (#1077)
 - Don't try to read the executable, if there's no permission (#1058)
 - Allow plugin's initialize() method to fail (#1096)
 - Fix some minor memory-leaks (#1009, )

Enhancements:
 - Allow users to influence pinning via __PSI_CPUMAP (#1086)
 - Dynamical dropping of message within psid (#992)
 - psid now has a hook-facility; currently it support PSIDHOOK_NODE_UP
   and PSIDHOOK_NODE_DOWN
 - Implement logger_finalize() in order to allow dynamical loggers (#1010)

Additional changes:
 - Version of the plugin API pushed to 102.

   (#792/jt:#2691).
 - Better handling of hanging file-systems while spawning processes (#879).

      for Sselect to time-out (jt:#3239).

Enhancements:
 - use selectors to handle clients' file-descriptors in psid.
 - allow to trigger Sselect() to start-over. Useful to enable modified
      fd-sets more quickly. Might help with jt:#3239.
 - allow to disable registered selectors temporarily.
 - enable stack protector, if supported (#796).

Additional changes:
 - less important RDP-messages suppressed per default. These might
      lead to bandwidth-problems on huge clusters due to created load.

Version 5.0.28:
===============
