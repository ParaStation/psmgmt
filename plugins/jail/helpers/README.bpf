The eBPF cgroup device controller implementation consists of two parts. The eBPF program itself
and an additional eBPF loader.

The eBPF program can be compiled into bytecode using clang:

clang -O2 -target bpf -c bpf_device_controller.c -o bpf_cgroup_device.o

Since the compiled bytecode is platform independent it will be ship with the psmgmt package.

The eBPF loader is a c program using libbpf.
