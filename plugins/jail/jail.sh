# Script to be executed by ParaStation's jail plugin each time a
# process will be jailed into the cgroup. Nevertheless, this
# functionality is independent of the actual cgroup plugin.
#
# This script is executed with the same permissions as the ParaStation
# daemon psid, i.e. typically with root permission! Thus, special care
# has to be taken when changing this script.
#
# This script will be called by the jail plugin via system() and get
# the process ID of the process to be jailed as an argument.
#
# This example will adjust the process' value of oom_score_adjust.
