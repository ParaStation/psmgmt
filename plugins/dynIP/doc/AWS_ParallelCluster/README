Assuming you do already have a Parallel Cluster setup on AWS.

1. Copy the HeadNode and ComputeNode directories into the right place
   so all scripts therein are executed in lexical order when a respective
   node is powered up.

2. Copy or link the following RPMs into the HeadNode directory:
   - libgit2
   - psconfig
   - psconfig-rsyncd
   - psmgmt
   - psmgmt-dynip
   - psmgmt-slurmutils

3. Copy or link the following RPMs into the ComputeNode directory:
   - libgit2
   - psconfig
   - psmgmt
   - psmgmt-dynip
   - psmgmt-psslurm
   - psmgmt-slurmutils
   - psmgmt-pspmix (optionally)

4. Power on your head node
