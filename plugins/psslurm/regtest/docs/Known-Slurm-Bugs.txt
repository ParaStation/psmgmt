This document lists known bugs in the slurm 14.03.4-2 distribution. Some of 
these result in failure of tests in this testsuite:

  * When specifying the stderr for a job with a format the scontrol output
    is not properly expanded. For some special cases we work around this
    issue in the regression testsuite driver.

  * The --task-prolog executable must be specified with an absolute path.
    This bug results in failure of the test prolog-epilog-rel.

  * The RSS rlimit is not properly propagated to the compute nodes. This 
    results in failure of the test propagate-RSS.
